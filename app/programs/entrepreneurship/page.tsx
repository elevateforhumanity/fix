      question: "Do I need a business idea before enrolling?",
      answer: "No. Week 1 includes a structured ideation process where you'll evaluate market opportunities, assess your skills and interests, and validate a business concept. Many students arrive with a vague idea and leave with a refined, tested business plan. Others discover entirely new directions during the program."
    },
    {
      question: "I already have a business. Is this program still useful?",
      answer: "Yes. About 40% of our students are existing business owners looking to formalize operations, improve marketing, fix their bookkeeping, or access funding. The program covers business structure optimization, financial management, and growth strategies that benefit businesses at any stage."
    },
    {
      question: "What will I have when I graduate?",
      answer: "A complete, lender-ready business plan; your LLC or DBA registered with the Indiana Secretary of State; an EIN from the IRS; a basic bookkeeping system set up in QuickBooks; a marketing plan with social media and local SEO strategy; and connections to SBA lenders and microloan partners."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does the program cost?",
      answer: "Tuition is $1,500 which includes all materials, business registration filing assistance, and QuickBooks access. Weekly payment plans ($250/week for 6 weeks) and BNPL options are available. This is a self-pay program."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you help me get funding for my business?",
      answer: "We connect you with funding sources but don't provide direct funding. You'll learn how to apply for SBA microloans (up to $50,000), prepare for bank loan applications, explore grant opportunities, and evaluate crowdfunding. Our network includes CDFI lenders, SBA resource partners, and local economic development organizations."
    },
    {
      question: "What industries do your graduates start businesses in?",
      answer: "Everything from barbershops and beauty salons to tax preparation offices, cleaning services, food trucks, e-commerce stores, consulting firms, and skilled trades contracting. The business fundamentals we teach apply to any industry."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there mentorship after the program ends?",
      answer: "Yes. Graduates are paired with a local business mentor for 3 months after completion. Mentors are experienced business owners who provide guidance on real challenges as you launch. You also retain access to our alumni network and quarterly business owner meetups."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the schedule like?",
      answer: "6 weeks, meeting Saturday mornings (9 AM–1 PM) plus one weekday evening session per week (6–8 PM). The Saturday sessions are workshop-style where you build your business plan in real time. Weekday sessions cover specific topics like marketing, bookkeeping, and legal structure."
