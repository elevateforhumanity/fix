    {
      question: "Do I need any experience to enroll?",
      answer: "No prior experience is required. The apprenticeship is designed for beginners. You'll start with basic nail care fundamentals — sanitation, tool identification, and client consultation — before progressing to advanced techniques like gel application, nail art, and acrylic sculpting."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the apprenticeship model work?",
      answer: "You train inside a licensed nail salon under the supervision of a licensed nail technician. You earn while you learn — performing services on real clients as your skills develop. Elevate provides the related technical instruction (classroom/online), and the salon provides the on-the-job training hours."
    },
    {
      question: "How many hours do I need to complete?",
      answer: "Indiana requires 450 hours of training for a nail technician license. This includes both on-the-job training at your salon placement and related technical instruction through Elevate. Most apprentices complete the program in 20–24 weeks depending on their schedule."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I get paid during the apprenticeship?",
      answer: "Yes. As an apprentice in a licensed salon, you earn wages for the hours you work. Pay varies by salon — most start at minimum wage or slightly above, with increases as your skills develop. Many apprentices also earn tips once they begin serving clients independently."
    },
    {
      question: "What license will I earn?",
      answer: "Upon completion, you'll be eligible to apply for an Indiana Nail Technician License through the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency (State Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners). You must pass the state board exam, which includes both written and practical components."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does the program cost?",
      answer: "Tuition is $3,500 which covers all related technical instruction, materials, practice supplies, and exam preparation. Weekly payment plans and BNPL options are available. Some salon sponsors offset a portion of tuition in exchange for a work commitment."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between this and cosmetology school?",
      answer: "Traditional cosmetology school requires 1,500 hours and covers hair, skin, and nails. Our nail technician apprenticeship focuses exclusively on nails (450 hours) and uses an earn-while-you-learn model instead of full-time classroom attendance. It's faster, more affordable, and you earn income during training."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I open my own nail salon after completing the program?",
      answer: "Yes, once you're licensed. Many nail technicians work in salons for 1–2 years to build their client base, then open their own studio or rent a booth. Pair this program with our Entrepreneurship course to build your business plan while completing your apprenticeship."
