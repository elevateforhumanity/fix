      question: "Do I need accounting experience to enroll?",
      answer: "No. This program is designed for complete beginners. We start with the fundamentals — what debits and credits are, how a chart of accounts works, and how to record everyday business transactions. No math beyond basic arithmetic is required."
    },
    {
      question: "What software will I learn?",
      answer: "You'll become proficient in QuickBooks Online, the most widely used small business accounting software. You'll learn setup, daily transactions, invoicing, bill pay, bank reconciliation, payroll, and financial reporting. You'll also be prepared for the QuickBooks Certified User exam."
    },
    {
      question: "How long is the program and what's the schedule?",
      answer: "8 weeks total. Classes meet two evenings per week (6:00–9:00 PM) plus self-paced LMS coursework you complete on your own schedule. Total instructional hours: approximately 96 hours including classroom, lab, and online modules."
    },
    {
      question: "What credentials will I earn?",
      answer: "You'll earn the QuickBooks Certified User credential (administered by Certiport/Intuit) and a Certificate of Completion from Elevate for Humanity. The QuickBooks certification is recognized by employers nationwide and validates your ability to manage business finances using QuickBooks."
    },
    {
      question: "What jobs can I get after completing this program?",
      answer: "Graduates work as bookkeepers, accounts payable/receivable clerks, payroll clerks, billing specialists, and office managers. Many also freelance as independent bookkeepers serving multiple small businesses. Indiana bookkeepers earn $38,000–$48,000 on average, with experienced bookkeepers earning $55,000+."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this to start my own bookkeeping business?",
      answer: "Yes. Many graduates launch freelance bookkeeping practices. You'll learn everything needed to manage client books — from onboarding a new client to delivering monthly financial statements. Pair this with our Entrepreneurship program for a complete business launch plan."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does the program cost?",
      answer: "Tuition is $2,800 which includes all materials, QuickBooks Online access, and one attempt at the QuickBooks Certified User exam. Weekly payment plans and BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) options are available. This program is self-pay — it is not currently funded through WorkOne/WIOA."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this program available online?",
      answer: "The program uses a hybrid model. Evening classroom sessions are held in-person at our Indianapolis training center. The LMS coursework (approximately 40% of the program) is completed online at your own pace. All materials are accessible 24/7 through the student portal."
